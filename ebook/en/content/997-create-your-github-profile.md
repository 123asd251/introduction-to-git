# Create your GitHub profile

Apart from looking awesome, a good GitHub profile let's people know what you can do and gives you a chance to show it off. Also employers often ask for a GitHub profile in job applications so this can be your chance to shine!

### Markdown

In order to create a GitHub profile you need to understand Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Check out this
[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images).

### Create a GitHub repository for your profile page

First of all you need to create a new repository. Use this link https://github.com/new to do so. You must name your repository the same as your GitHub username as shown below:

Then you will discover your secret/special repository! 
Make the repository public and select add a README file. Then you are done creating your repository. I recommend making your repository private whilst you work on it and then make it public once complete. Now time to add content and make it shine.

### Adding a header

The first thing people on your profile notice is the header. The markdown needed is:

```
![Repository Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github-username/github-username/banner_photo.png)
```
For example:
```
![Repository Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elenajp/elenajp/main/me_diving.png)
```
Here is a website that allows you to generate beautiful header images for your GitHub profile READMEs. https://reheader.glitch.me/



### Mention what you are up to
You can show visitors to your profile what you are up to and what you are working on. This is a great way for a them to get to know a bit more about you.
