# Forking in Git

When contributing to an open source project you will not be able to make the changes directly to the project. Only the repository maintainers have that privilege.

What you need to do instead is to fork the specific repository, make the changes to the forked project and then submit a pull request to the original project. You will learn more about pull requests in the next chapters.
